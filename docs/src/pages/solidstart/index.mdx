# Getting Started

## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the packages

```bash copy
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/solid solidjs-dropzone
```

I don't use React, I use [Solid](/solidstart)

### Add env variables

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign up](/create-account) and create one from
  the [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>
</Steps>

## Set up in your SolidStart application

Continue setting up with the [SolidStart guide](/solidstart/server)
